# 3D Convolution

<b> Environment Setup <b/>
  
For the proper execution of the scripts there is an .yml anaconda environment with all the necessary dependencies
needed. All you have to do is to create a conda environment in your machine pointing in my .yml file.

<b> Theory Behind Convolution <b/>
  
A 3D Convolution is a type of convolution where the kernel slides in 3 dimensions as opposed to 2 dimensions with 2D
convolutions. You can think of a video as a 3D Array where X Axis depicts the pixel rows, Y Axis depicts the pixel
columns and Z Axis depicts the time or in other words the total amount of the frames.
